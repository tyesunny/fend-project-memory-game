## Notice

This project is done as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). If you are like me and rather bad with styling, but wish to create your own version of the game, feel free to grab the starter files [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
